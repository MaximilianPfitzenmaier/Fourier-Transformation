## :electric_plug: Preparation

Before you clone this repository you should make sure to get the following things done first.

### Node.js

Since we use languages like SASS we need libraries that help us to build all the required assets for the Project.
Using the latest LTS version of node.js should work just fine: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
