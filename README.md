# 2D Fourier-Transformation Application
"The Fourier Transformation App is a web-based application that enables users to perform Fourier transformations on different functions. With an intuitive interface, users can easily select from a range of pre-defined functions or draw their own to analyze their frequency spectra. This app provides a visual representation of the Fourier transformation results, making it an invaluable tool for students, researchers, and anyone interested in signal processing and frequency analysis."

Feel free to modify and tailor these descriptions to align with the specific features and functionalities of your application.

## :electric_plug: Preparation

Before you clone this repository you should make sure to get the following things done first.

### Node.js

Since we use languages like SASS we need libraries that help us to build all the required assets for the Project.
Using the latest LTS version of node.js should work just fine: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

## :checkered_flag: Installation

### Clone the repository

1. Open a terminal and move to your folder.
2. Being there, clone this repository into a new directory called 'project' with `git clone git@github.com:MaximilianPfitzenmaier/Fourier-Transformation.git fft`.

### Build assets

1. Move to your app folder with `cd app/`
2. Install all npm dependendies by typing `npm install` or just `npm i`
3. Run `npm run build` to build all assets (e.g. styles)

### Run React app

1. Run `npm run start` to start the App. A browser window with the app should now open.

### Done!

You should now be able to reach your site.
